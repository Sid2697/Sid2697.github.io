- title: Automatic Garbage Detection and Collection
  image: AGDC.png
  description: Lead a team of three for creating a robot using a RaspberryPi. It was capable of detecting waste bottles and picking them up.<br>Developed an algorithm for getting a rough estimate of the distance of the garbage from the robot (with an error margin of 2 cm).<br>Developed a path planning algorithm based on the concept of PID (by considering bottle as the centre).<br>One of the top 4% projects selected for demonstration at SSIP annual conference.

- title: Anime Classification
  image: Anime.jpeg
  description: In this project, I worked on autoencoders to learn the features from 1,40,000 images. Then using the trained autoencoder with added convolution layers to classify the anime to answer various questions with 74.6% accuracy like - <br> Does the image contain any nudity or sexual content? (Yes, No) <br> Is this an interesting image or not? (Yes, no). <br><br><br>
