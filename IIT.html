<h2>About</h2>
<p class="just">This webpage contains information of all the work done at IIT-Gandhinagar.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="just">Creation of a pipeline that takes in 3D point clouds and gives out a complete 3D geometric model is a pretty vast
    topic which includes various currently focused research concepts like Rigid and Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration,
    3D object recognition, and Point Cloud Completion. These generated 3D models find various applications in the domain
    of 3D Computer Vision, 3D Graphics, architecture simulation, games graphics, animated movies and 3D documentation
    of objects, and many other renowned fields. This research project aims at using various digital geometry processing
    approaches for preserving and restoring cultural heritage. </p>

<p class="just">Task here is to develop an end-to-end pipeline which begins with <b>acquisition</b> of 2.5D point clouds using a
    long-range laser scanner followed by <b>point cloud registration</b> to obtain a complete 3D point cloud and if the point
    cloud is incomplete then applying point cloud completion algorithms for completing the point clouds, conversion of
    point cloud to mesh, the <b>mesh</b> is then converted to <b>surface</b> and finally a complete 3D model is obtained
    which can be 3D printed. My work was focused on understanding and applying various point cloud registration
    and point cloud completion methods.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<!--TODO: Hyperlink references to the reference section.-->
<p class="just">Geometry Processing is involved with efficient acquisition, representation, optimization, editing, and
simulation of geometric objects.
There is a large boost in the availability of 3D data due to the decreasing prices of geometry acquisition devices,
like 3D laser scanners (Fig.1), LiDAR scanners. Geometry processing is playing an important role in a large range of
applications. Examples include video games, animation, TV, building design, web design, CAD, interactive shape editing,
    simulations for medical applications and movie productions<sup>[1]</sup>. Problems arising in these highly
diverse fields follow the same fundamental geometry principles proves geometry processing to be a potentially growing
    field of high potential impact research<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

<p class="just"> For converting a point cloud (Fig.1) to a usable 3D model various steps are to be performed. All the steps are explained
    in section 2. Section 3 covers various approaches I took to solve various steps of the pipeline. Section 4 shows some
of the results obtained using approaches described in section 3. Section 5 concludes the discussion with possible future
work.</p>

<h2>2. Pipeline Constructed</h2>
<p class="just">The task of the following pipeline is to convert a less usable point clouds to more usable complete 3D
models.</p>
<h3> 2.1 Data Acquisition</h3>
<p class="just">Data acquisition is the process of converting a signal measuring real physical condition to a digital
signal that can be manipulated by a digital computer<sup>[3]</sup>. For our purpose of collecting 3D data, we used the
FARO Focus 3D X 330 HRD<sup>[4]</sup> long-range laser scanner (Fig.2). It is a portable laser scanner capable of taking scans
up to 330 meters. The laser scanner throws a laser beam on to the object and calculates how long it takes the laser
    beam to bounce back from the surface and return. This is how the distance of the object from the laser
    scanner is calculated and the point cloud is constructed<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>

<p class="just">Fig.3 shows the basic structure of a 3D laser scanner. The mirror rotates on its axis to form a 3D scan of the surroundings
The tripod is used to keep the scanner stable while scanning. And it has various indicator lights for indication various
operations (their function changes with various manufacturers).</p>
