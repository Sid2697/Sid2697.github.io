<h1 align="center">Facility Layout using Genetic Algorithm</h1>
<p align="center"><a href="https://sid2697.github.io">Siddhant Bansal</a><br>Meditab Software, Inc.<br>siddhant2697@gmail.com</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p class="just">This is a web page dedicated to the work done by me at Meditab Software, Inc.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="just">For any organization to make the maximum profit it is important to have an efficient and effective
manufacturing unit. For such a unit it is necessary to give special attention to facility layout. Facility layout is
defined as an effective arrangement of different manufacturing units to achieve desired production results. There are a few
things that can be considered for facility layout like, total available space, time for manufacturing a single batch of
product, user access points of the machine for convenient operations. An efficient layout is the one which ensures a
steady and smooth flow of equipment, production material, and manpower at minimum expense.</p>
<p class="just">Manually figuring out the best possible layout satisfying all the constraints can be a difficult task
as there can be infinitely many ways of arranging a facility with <i>n</i> number of constraints. This is the reason we
    consider Genetic Algorithm to find the best layout for us with the given set of constraints.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="just">Layout Optimisation Problem refers to the problem of determining positions of modules in a layout for
    optimizing multiple constraint objectives specific to the problem statement. The discussed problem statement can be
    divided into two subdivisions as continuous layout optimization problem and discrete layout optimization problem.
    Researchers like [1], [2], [3], [4] have contributed immensely for the continuous layout optimisation problem, whereas
    [5], [6], [7] made numerous efforts for a discrete layout optimisation problem. Apart from mentioned categorization,
    there are also additional possible ways of categorizing Layout optimization problem as an equal-area problem,
    unequal area problem [8], Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and Quadratic Set Covering Problem (QSCP) [9].</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/General.svg" alt="General Configurations in Facility Layout"></p>
<p align="center">Fig.1: Few of the many possible ways in which 4 modules can be arranged in a facility.</p>
<p class="just">For solving the above-mentioned problem scenarios, a wide array of algorithms have been employed.
    Genetic algorithms were used by [9] for flexible manufacturing system optimisation, genetic search by [10] for
    unequal-area facility layout optimization, genetic programming by [11]  for Geometry and sizing optimisation of
    the discrete structure. This problem statement has also been assessed by researchers from diverse applied engineering
    fields. [12] have explored the same for optimizing placement of components on the PCB using genetic algorithms. The
    above-mentioned methods use vectors as the representation of the modules (units to be arranged in a given space
    called environment). Whereas our approach uses 2D matrices as the representations of the modules and produces some
    good environment.</p>
<p class="just">The work can be explored in two phases, first by learning about Genetic Algorithms in Section 2. Then
    by analyzing the environment created by us called ELOPE (Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator)
    in Section 3.</p>
<h2>2. Genetic Algorithm</h2>
<p class="just">The genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm that tries to mimic
    the actual biological process in the hope of discovering good solutions which were first introduced by [13].
The genetic algorithm is analogous to Darwinian natural mutation and selection, it is a part of ‘randomized heuristics’
    which does not depend on the prior knowledge of various features of the domain whereas it depends on the randomized
    choice of operators.</p>
<h3>2.1 Basic flow of the algorithm</h3>
<p class="just">The genetic algorithm transforms a population of individual solutions repeatedly.  At each iteration, the
    algorithm chooses some individuals randomly from the current population which acts as the parents to produce
    the offsprings for the coming generation. The process continues for some generations, and the population evolves
    toward a local or global optimal solution. </p>
<p class="just">Three main steps are used in the algorithm to create the future generation from the current generation:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Selection</b> rules select the parents, that are used to create the next generation.</li>
    <li><b>Crossover</b> is used to define rules of combining parents to generate children.</li>
    <li><b>Mutation</b> is used to apply random changes to some of the individuals from the new generation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="just">Let us learn about all the above steps one by one.</p>
<h3>2.2 Selection</h3>
<p class="just">First of all the fitness score of the entire population is calculated. Fitness score indicates the value of
    a particular individual, in our case the more the fitness score of an environment is the better it is. The
    population is then sorted on the fitness score. Then we use any one of the following two techniques for the selection
    of the parents:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Here we generate a random number between the minimum and maximum score. The individuals who have the score
        higher than this number are taken to the next step of crossover.</li>
    <li>In this second method either 0 or 1 is generated. If 1 is generated then all the environments at even index are chosen,
        else the once at odd index are chosen and taken to the next step of crossover.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.3 Crossover</h3>
<p class="just">Crossover is used for exploring the sample space in the Genetic Algorithm, we implement 2 different
    crossover strategies, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the most basic strategy, we choose any environment at random and take the module’s position from it for
        creating a new environment. If there is any conflict in creating the environment then a completely new
        environment is used as a child.</li>
    <li>The second strategy involves using the fitness score of the environment. The environment with a higher score is
        given an 80% probability of contributing to the crossover process, whereas the one with the lower score is
        given the remaining 20% probability.</li>
</ol>
<p>For old population P, new population P′ is generated as P′ = C (P) where C is a crossover function.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/Cross.svg" alt="Crossover demo" style="height: 600px;"></p>
<p align="center">Fig.2: Crossover operation between Parent 1 and Parent 2 results in Child (a new environment).</p>
<h3>2.4 Mutation</h3>
<p class="just">The mutation is used for exploiting the sample space in the Genetic Algorithm, we implement 3 different
    strategies in our plugin, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Shift mutation</b>: This strategy involves moving the module up, down, right or left by n number of blocks.</li>
    <li><b>Tilt mutation</b>: This strategy involves rotating the module by 180 degrees.</li>
    <li><b>Rotate mutation</b>: This strategy involves rotating the module by 90 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/Mutation.svg" alt="Mutation demo"></p>
<p align="center">Fig.3: Mutation operation taking a random individual and transforming the modules using various
    operations like shift, tilt and rotate.</p>
<h3>2.5 Complete Algorithm</h3>
<p class="just">Here is the pseudo-code for implementing the Genetic Algorithm:</p>
<p class="just"><b>Input: </b>desired fitness score, the maximum number of generations<br><b>Output: </b>Parameter:
    Fitness strategy<br><ol>
    <li>Generate Initial Population</li>
    <li>Set population score to zero</li>
    <li>Set generation number to zero</li>
    <li><b>while</b> population score < desired score or generation number < maximum generations <b>do</b></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Get sorted population, population score, and best individual score</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform selection</span> </li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform crossover</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Sort population</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform Mutation</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Increment generation number</span> </li>
    <li><b>end while</b></li>
</ol></p>
<p class="just">The algorithm can be visualised as shown in Fig.4.</p>

<h2>3. ELOPE: Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator</h2>
<p class="just">Current ameliorations in Evolutionary Strategies have allowed us to achieve phenomenal accuracy invariants
    of optimization problems. However, for the layout optimization problem, there doesn’t exist a platform
    adept enough to challenge off-the-shelf algorithms to the fullest extent. For addressing the mentioned problem
    statement, we introduce Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator (ELOPE), a platform for solving a
    large spectrum of layout optimization problems. ELOPE’s major contributions are its proposed 2D rectangular
    representation for the environment, multi-objective optimization, pre-defined plugins for evolutionary algorithms
    and visualization of the generated layouts.</p>
<h3>3.1 About ELOPE</h3>
<p class="just">ELOPE, is a platform for evaluating and comparing different evolutionary algorithms for solving
    layout problems using evolutionary algorithms.<br>Major advantages of ELOPE are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>ELOPE provides a scalable playground</b> as it can be used to generate a diverse set of layout customizations
        for various applications.</li>
    <li><b>It provides a rich set of plugins</b> that makes it easy to use for developing various functionalities on the
        top of it.</li>
    <li><b>It provides a visualisation module</b> which can be used to visualise layouts generated by the algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/ELOPE_ARC.png" alt="ELOPE architecture information." style="width:1000px;height:550px"> </p>
<p align="center">Fig.5: ELOPE’s architecture and interaction with the algorithm.</p>
<h3>3.2 Architecture</h3>
<p class="just">The key idea for ELOPE is to avail the community with a comprehensive platform for solving the layout
    optimisation problems. ELOPE is written in Python to avail the implemented operations for matrix manipulation and
    its matured range of libraries for applied programming. This choice also caters the developers to prototype the
    ideas relatively faster and help direct the efforts on the algorithm than the interfaces. ELOPE stands out as a
    bridge between the problem statement and the algorithm employed to solve it. Fig.5 illustrates that
    relationship via the user-defined data-flow originating from the problem statement at hand. The interactions among
    the sub-modules of ELOPE and the optimization strategy of choice are also represented.</p>
<p class="just"><p> ELOPE represents the multi-floor space as a set of 3D grid boxes, which behave as the fundamental
    cell. Each grid box can be represented as G<sub>x,y,z</sub> where x, y, and z where x ∈ {1,...,X}, y ∈ {1,...,Y} and
    z ∈ {1,...,Z}. The X, Y, and Z are the inputs derived from the application-specific configuration which denote the
    width, length, and the number of floors respectively for the floor space. Each grid box acquires a token value (g) from
    the grid token set (G). Here g ∈ G where,</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?G = \{-2, -1, 0, M\}" border="0"/></p>
<p class="just">where,<br>
−2 represents blocked or unusable space<br>
−1 represents vacant or usable space<br>
0 represents the connections between modules<br>
M represents module ID (explained later in this section)</p>
<h3>3.3 Module</h3>
<p class="just">The physical components which are supposed to occupy the floor-space or in other words whose positions
    are to be optimized are addressed as module henceforth. The properties of the module (P<sub>M</sub>) for a single floor is
    represented as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P_M = \{M_{x, y}, M_{co}, M_d, M_{ui}, l, w\}" border="0"/></p>
<h3>3.4 Application Specific Configuration</h3>
<p class="just">The information corresponding to the layout being optimised acts as an input for the ELOPE environment.
    This information is represented in a configuration file consisting of fields related to the physical floor-space,
    constraints, and specifications about the components to be placed optimally in the layout.</p>
<h3>3.5 Constraint Enforcement</h3>
<p class="just">The ELOPE configuration file generates constraint enforcement which acts as an input for layout
    generator. Constraint enforcement can be categorized as general layout constraints and application layout
    constraints. Constraints are defined using the information from grid token set G. For example,
    general layout constraints include layouts containing non-overlapping modules, modules that should be represented
    within the boundary of layout whereas application-specific constraints include constraints such as user accessibility
    constraint, blockage constraint, and module adjacency constraint.</p>
<h3>3.6 Plugins</h3>
<p class="just">ELOPE’s plugins are divided into 3 major categories:<br>
<ol>
    <li class="just"><b>Module manipulation plugin</b>: This set of the plugin is used to move the modules within the layout. They include:<br>
        <br><b>Shift Plugin</b>: This plugin takes in the module id and shifts that particular module by n position in
        the given direction. A mathematical formulation of shift plugin is as follows: For right/left shift:
        <p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?({c}', {d}') = (c, d \pm n)" border="0"/></p> For top/down shift: <p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?({c}', {d}') = (c \pm n, d)" border="0"/></p> where,<br>
        <br>c, c′ represents the previous and new top left corner’s row position respectively <br> d, d′ represents the
        previous and new top left corner’s column position respectively <br> n represents the number of blocks to move <br><br>
<b>Rotate Plugin</b>: This plugin takes in the module id and rotates the module by 90 or 180 degrees, if and only
    if there is sufficient space to rotate the module.</li><br>
<li class="just"><b>Layout manipulation plugin</b>: This set of plugin modifies the layout as a whole. Geometric transformations
    applied to the layout can be included in this category.</li><br>
<li class="just"><b>Layout assessment plugin</b>: These plugins are used for assigning a score to the layout by assessing various parameters
    of the layout. ELOPE is equipped with various plugins like Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, minimal path
    plugin, and minimal area plugin. What follows is a mathematical description of the minimal area and minimal path plugins.</li>
<ul>
    <li><b>Minimal path plugin</b>: The lowest length of the connecting path between 2 modules is the number of minimum steps
        required to move from module i to module j represented as p<sub>i, j</sub>. The overall path length among the
        modules is represented as p<sub>l</sub> which is calculated as follows: <p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_{l} = \sum_{i,j=1,j\neq i}^{n}p_{i,j}" border="0"/></p>
    <li><b>Minimal area plugin</b>: The minimal effective area covered by the modules is calculated as follows:<p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_m = (x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min})" border="0"/></p>
    where,<br>
a<sub>m</sub> represents the overall area occupied by the modules<br>
x<sub>max</sub>, x<sub>min</sub> represents the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the module respectively<br>
y<sub>max</sub>, y<sub>min</sub> represents the maximum and minimum y-coordinates of the module respectively<br>
    <li>To bring above objectives on the small scale and giving equal weight to all the objectives, we do normalization:</li>
    <p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_n = \frac{(p_l - p_{min})}{(p_{max} - p_{min})}" border="0"/></p>
    where,<br>
p<sub>n</sub> represents the normalized path<br>
p<sub>l</sub> represents overall path length<br>
    p<sub>min</sub> represents minimum path length between modules<br>
p<sub>max</sub> represents the perimeter of the layout<br>
    <p align="center"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_n = \frac{(a_m - a_{min})}{(a_{max} - a_{min})}" border="0"/></p>
    where,<br>
a<sub>n</sub> represents the normalized area<br>
a<sub>m</sub> represents the overall area occupied by the modules<br>
    a<sub>min</sub> represents the sum of the area of all the modules<br>
a<sub>max</sub> represents the area of the layout<br>
</ul>
</ol></p>
<h3>3.7 Visualization module</h3>
<p class="just">The layout that is internally represented as a Numpy array is not a good way when it comes to
    visualizing the layout. This is the reason ELOPE comes with a visualization module for converting all the
    information from the Numpy array to a form that can be easily understood and visualized. Fig.6 shows the
    layout generated using Visualization Module.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/Vis.png" alt="Visualisation Module"></p>
<p align="center">Fig.6: The internal representation of the layout is converted to the form which is convenient for
    visualization. Demonstration of how the main layout looks after applying shift, delete and rotate plugin is shown.</p>
<h3>3.8 ELOPE with Genetic Algorithm</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/GA_E.png" alt="ELOPE in Genetic Algorithm"> </p>
<p align="center">Fig.7: The use of ELOPE to develop the genetic algorithm is demonstrated.
    The mapping of different strategies of genetic algorithm is shown with the corresponding modules of ELOPE used.</p>
<p class="just">All these plugins of the genetic algorithm are developed using ELOPE. As shown in Fig.7, generate
    population is build using ELOPE’s Layout Generator, crossover and mutation is build using module and layout
    manipulation plugin, whereas selection and fitness strategy is developed using constraint enforcement and
    layout assessment plugin. This demonstrates the purpose of ELOPE in developing different algorithms.</p>
<h2>4. Results</h2>
<p class="just">For getting an optimized industrial warehouse environment the algorithm was made to evolve until the
    desired score was achieved. In Fig.8, the tracks of the conveyor are represented between the modules. Clearly,
    in Fig.8 (a) the conveyor length is higher than as shown in Fig.8 (b) and also the area occupied by
    the modules and conveyor is reduced to a certain extent. Overall we get an optimized layout after evolving for
    160 generations through the genetic algorithm.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/Results.png" alt="Results!"> </p>
<p align="center">Fig.8: (a) shows the initial layout where modules are placed randomly, (b) shows the optimized
    layout evolved after 160 generations, (c) represents the best layout score and (d) represents the overall generation
    score.</p>
<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p class="just">We have presented a way in which we can use ELOPE to apply the genetic algorithm for facility layout
    optimization. ELOPE can be elegantly used as a playground for developing, understanding and evaluating not just
    evolutionary algorithms but also Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other search optimization techniques. ELOPE in its
    future version aims to support various nuances of layout optimisation problems along with 3D visualisation modules.</p>
