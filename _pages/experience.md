<h3>Research Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>Research Fellow <em>(August&rsquo;19 &ndash; January&rsquo;20)</em></li>
	<li>Worked on improving word recognition and retrieval in large document collections for Indian scripts like Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil.
	The work was supervised by Praveen Krishnan and Prof. C.V. Jawahar.</li>
	<li> Major contributions: </li>
	<ul>
		<li> Accomplished improved word accuracy by 1.4% for Hindi and 1.8% for Telugu by merging text hypotheses and deep embeddings. </li>
		<li> Proposed techniques like Naive Merge, Query Expansion for improving word retrieval by 11.12% for the Hindi language. </li>
	</ul>
	<li> Created an OCR for Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Worked on a novel semi-supervised training technique for Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (using CTC loss). Reported an improved word accuracy by 2.5% and character accuracy by 5%. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Research Intern <em>(March&rsquo;19 &ndash; August&rsquo;19)</em></li>
	<li> Worked on the project titled "Cultural Heritage Preservation and Restoration using Digital 3D Models", under <a href='https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/'>Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman</a>. The project was supported by <a href='https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/'>NVIDIA</a> and <a href='https://imprint-india.org/'>IMPRINT</a> (Impacting Research Innovation and Technology) an initiative of the Government of India.</li>
	<li> Major contributions: </li>
	<ul>
		<li> Data collection in form of point clouds using Faro Focus 3D laser scanner.</li>
		<li> Point Cloud Alignment using algorithms like ICP (Using Eigenvalues Eigenvectors, SVD, and studied various deep learning approaches like Deep Closest Point, DeepICP, Discriminative Optimization, Auto-Encoder Approach, PointNetLK).</li>
		<li>Developed an algorithm for Point Cloud Completion using Fully-Connected Auto-Encoder and got some decent results on <a href='http://completion3d.stanford.edu/'>ShapeNet dataset</a>.</li>
	</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Artificial Intelligence Intern <em>(September&rsquo;18 &ndash; March&rsquo;19)</em></li>
	<li>Worked on the project titled "Facility Layout Optimization using Genetic Algorithm".</li>
	<li>Major contributions:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Successful in generating optimal facility layouts, by implementing ELOPE (Evolutionary Layout Optimization and Evaluator) and using it with the Genetic Algorithm, this led to a decrease in travelling time by 75% for the DosePacker robots leading to more efficient DosePacker system.</li>
		<li>Created an automatic log file analyzer capable of predicting a possible machine breakdown, leading to a 70% decrease in maintenance time of the DosePacker system and saving on maintenance costs.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Artificial Intelligence Research Intern <em>(June&rsquo;18 &ndash; July&rsquo;18)</em></li>
	<li>Worked on the project titled "Credibility Examination of Human Footprint Using Minutiae Features". The project was supported by NVIDIA by providing DGX 1 Tesla V100.</li>
	<li>Major contributions:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Collected dataset of footprints from 180 volunteers, using a paper scanner at 600dpi.</li>
		<li>Developed a custom Convolution Neural Network for classifying humans based on the shape and size of their footprints. The network was trained on the data collected earlier.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<li><strong>Bioscan Research</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>Data Analyst Intern <em>(June&rsquo;18 &ndash; July&rsquo;18)</em></li>
	<li>Worked on applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to an onsite detection tool for instantaneous scanning of intracranial bleeding.</li>
	<li>Major contributions:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Created software capable of tracking patients using Python and SQLite, leading to better workflow for the people working on collecting the brain scans.</li>
		<li>Successful in detecting actual signal amidst noise (coming from a brain scan using a near-infrared laser scanner), by implementing an automatic signal extractor using Python.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
