<h1 align="center">Facility Layout using Genetic Algorithm</h1>
<p align="center"><a href="https://sid2697.github.io">Siddhant Bansal</a><br>Meditab Software, Inc.<br>siddhant2697@gmail.com</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p class="just">This is web page dedicated to the work done by me at Meditab Software, Inc.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="just">For any organization to make the maximum profit it is important to have an efficient and effective
manufacturing unit. For such a unit it is necessary to give special attention to facility layout. Facility layout is
defined as an effective arrangement of different manufacturing units to achieve desired production results. There are a few
things that can be considered for facility layout like, total available space, time for manufacturing a single batch of
product, user access points of the machine for convenient operations. An efficient layout is the one which ensures a
steady and smooth flow of equipment, production material, and manpower at minimum expense.</p>
<p class="just">Manually figuring out the best possible layout satisfying all the constraints can be a difficult task
as there can be infinitely many ways of arranging a facility with <i>n</i> number of constraints. This is the reason we
    consider Genetic Algorithm to find the best layout for us with the given set of constraints. <b>[ADD ABOUT GA]</b></p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="just">Layout Optimisation Problem refers to the problem of determining positions of modules in a layout for
    optimizing multiple constraint objectives specific to the problem statement. The discussed problem statement can be
    divided into two subdivisions as continuous layout optimization problem and discrete layout optimization problem.
    Researchers like [1], [2], [3], [4] have contributed immensely for the continuous layout optimisation problem, whereas
    [5], [6], [7] made numerous efforts for a discrete layout optimisation problem. Apart from mentioned categorization,
    there are also additional possible ways of categorizing Layout optimization problem as equal-area problem,
    unequal area problem [8], Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and Quadratic Set Covering Problem (QSCP) [9].</p>
<p align="center"><b>CREATE A DIAGRAM FOR GENERAL FACILITY LAYOUT</b></p>
<p class="just">For solving the above-mentioned problem scenarios, a wide array of algorithms have been employed.
    Genetic algorithms were used by [9] for flexible manufacturing system optimisation, genetic search by [10] for
    unequal-area facility layout optimization, genetic programming by [11]  for Geometry and sizing optimisation of
    the discrete structure. This problem statement has also been assessed by researchers from diverse applied engineering
    fields. [12] have explored the same for optimizing placement of components on the PCB using genetic algorithms. The
    above-mentioned methods use vectors as the representation of the modules (units to be arranged in a given space
    called environment). Whereas our approach uses 2D matrices as the representations of the modules and produces some
    good environment.</p>
<p class="just">The work can be explored in two phases, first by learning about Genetic Algorithms in Section 2. Then
    by analyzing the environment created by us called ELOPE (Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator)
    in Section 3.</p>
<h2>2. Genetic Algorithm</h2>
<p class="just">The genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm that tries to mimic
    the actual biological process in a hope of discovering good solutions which was first introduced by [13].
The genetic algorithm is analogous to Darwinian natural mutation and selection, it is a part of ‘randomized heuristics’
    which does not depend on the prior knowledge of various features of the domain whereas it depends on the randomized
    choice of operators.</p>
<h3>2.1 Basic flow of the algorithm</h3>
<p class="just">The genetic algorithm transforms a population of individual solutions repeatedly.  At each iteration, the
    algorithm chooses some individuals randomly from the current population which acts at the parents to produce
    the offsprings for the coming generation. The process continues for some generations, and the population evolves
    toward an local or global optimal solution. </p>
<p class="just">Three main steps are used in the algorithm to create the future generation from the current generation:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Selection</b> rules selects the parents, that are used to create the next generation.</li>
    <li><b>Crossover</b> is used to define rules of combining parents to generate children.</li>
    <li><b>Mutation</b> is used to apply random changes to some of the individuals from the new generation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="just">Lets learn about all the above steps one by one.</p>
<h3>2.2 Selection</h3>
<p class="just">First of all fitness score of the entire population is calculated. Fitness score indicates the value of
    a particular individual, in our case the more the fitness score of an environment is the more better it is. The
    population is then sorted on the fitness score. Then we use any one of the following two techniques for selection
    of the parents:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Here we generate a random number between the minimum and maximum score. The individuals who have the score
        higher than this number are taken to the next step of crossover.</li>
    <li>In this method either 0 or 1 is generated. If 1 is generated then all the environments at even index are chosen,
        else the once at odd index are chosen and taken to the next step of crossover.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.3 Crossover</h3>
<p class="just">Crossover is used for exploring the sample space in the Genetic Algorithm, we implement 2 different
    crossover strategies, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the most basic strategy, we choose any environment at random and take the module’s position from it for
        creating a new environment. If there is any conflict in creating the environment then a completely new
        environment is used as a child.</li>
    <li>The second strategy involves using the fitness score of the environment. The environment with a higher score is
        given an 80% probability of contributing in the crossover process, whereas the one with the lower score is
        given the remaining 20% probability.</li>
</ol>
<p>For old population P, new population P′ is generated as P′ = C (P) where C is crossover function.</p>
<p align="center"><b>CREATE A DIAGRAM FOR CROSSOVER</b></p>
<h3>2.4 Mutation</h3>
<p class="just">Mutation is used for exploiting the sample space in the Genetic Algorithm, we implement 3 different
    strategies in our plugin, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Shift mutation</b>: This strategy involves moving the module up, down, right or left by n number of blocks.</li>
    <li><b>Tilt mutation</b>: This strategy involves rotating the module by 180 degrees.</li>
    <li><b>Rotate mutation</b>: This strategy involves rotating the module by 90 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><b>CREATE A DIAGRAM FOR MUTATION</b></p>
<h3>2.5 Complete Algorithm</h3>
<p class="just">Here is the pseudo code for implementing Genetic Algorithm:</p>
<p class="just"><b>Input: </b>desired fitness score, maximum number of generations<br><b>Output: </b>Parameter:
    Fitness strategy<br><ol>
    <li>Generate Initial Population</li>
    <li>Set population score to zero</li>
    <li>Set generation number to zero</li>
    <li><b>while</b> population score < desired score or generation number < maximum generations <b>do</b></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Get sorted population, population score and best individual score</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform selection</span> </li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform crossover</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Sort population</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Perform Mutation</span></li>
    <li><span class="tab">Increment generation number</span> </li>
    <li><b>end while</b></li>
</ol></p>

<h2>3. ELOPE: Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator</h2>
<p class="just">Current ameliorations in Evolutionary Strategies have allowed us to achieve phenomenal accuracy in
    variants of optimization problems. However, for the layout optimization problem, there doesn’t exist a platform
    adept enough to challenge off-the-shelf algorithms to the fullest extent. For addressing the mentioned problem
    statement, we introduce Evolutionary Layout Optimization Playground and Evaluator (ELOPE), a platform for solving a
    large spectrum of layout optimization problems. ELOPE’s major contributions are its proposed 2D rectangular
    representation for the environment, multi-objective optimization, pre-defined plugins for evolutionary algorithms
    and visualization of the generated layouts.</p>
<h3>3.1 About ELOPE</h3>
<p class="just">ELOPE, is a platform for evaluating and comparing different evolutionary algorithms for solving
    layout problems using evolutionary algorithms.<br>Major advantages of ELOPE are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>ELOPE provides a scalable playground</b> as it can be used to generate diverse set of layout customizations
        for various applications.</li>
    <li><b>It provides a rich set of plugins</b> that makes it easy to use for developing various functionalities on the
        top of it.</li>
    <li><b>It provides visualisation module</b> which can be used to visualise layouts generated by the algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img src="Meditab_files/ELOPE_ARC.png" alt="ELOPE architecture information." style="width:1000px;height:550px"> </p>
<p align="center">Fig.X: ELOPE’s architecture and interaction with the algorithm.</p>
<h3>3.2 Architecture</h3>
<p class="just">The key idea for ELOPE is to avail the community with a comprehensive platform for solving the layout
    optimisation problems. ELOPE is written in Python to avail the implemented operations for matrix manipulation and
    its matured range of libraries for applied programming. This choice also caters the developers to prototype the
    ideas relatively faster and help direct the efforts on the algorithm than the interfaces. ELOPE stands out as a
    bridge between the problem statement and the algorithm employed to solve it. Figure <b>X</b> illustrates that
    relationship via the user-defined data-flow originating from the problem statement at hand. The interactions among
    the sub-modules of ELOPE and the optimization strategy of choice are also represented.</p>
